## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Lottie animations not showing
- Check `pubspec.yaml` has correct assets path
- Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
- Verify JSON files are in `assets/lottie/` directory
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Colors look wrong
- Verify `accent_colors.dart` is exported in `config.dart`
- Check import: `import 'package:tuneatlas/src/src.dart';`
- Ensure `AccentColors.forStation()` is called correctly
- Test with different station genres

### Shadows not visible
- Check theme mode (shadows more visible in light mode)
- Verify opacity values (might need adjustment)
- Increase blur radius if needed
- Check device performance settings

### Performance issues
- Reduce shadow blur radius values
- Disable Lottie animations temporarily
- Check for memory leaks
- Profile with Flutter DevTools

### Hot reload not working
- Try hot restart instead
- Clean and rebuild: `flutter clean && flutter run`
- Check for syntax errors
- Verify all imports are correct
