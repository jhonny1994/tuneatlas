## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "Sonic Canvas"

**Core Idea:** Radio is invisible art. We make it visible through:
- 🌈 Emotion-driven color (genre-based gradients)
- 🏔️ Spatial depth (layered glassmorphism)
- 🎭 Motion storytelling (physics-based animations)
- ✍️ Artistic typography (bold, expressive hierarchy)
- 📊 Audio visualization (waveforms, pulse effects)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Get Results in Hours)

### Option A: Maximum Visual Impact (2 hours)
**Best for:** Immediate "wow factor"

1. **Gradient Station Cards** (1 hour)
   - Add `audio_gradients.dart` file
   - Update `station_card.dart` with gradient backgrounds
   - Result: Cards go from flat → vibrant & artistic

2. **Live Waveform** (1 hour)
   - Add `live_waveform.dart` widget
   - Place on currently playing cards
   - Result: Visual audio feedback

### Option B: Premium Feel (4 hours)
**Best for:** Complete transformation

1. Gradient Cards (1 hour)
2. Glassmorphic Mini Player (2 hours)
3. Waveform Animation (1 hour)

**Result:** App looks like premium music streaming service

### Option C: Full Upgrade (20-30 hours)
**Best for:** Production-ready artistic UI

Follow the 4-week roadmap in `UI_DESIGN_UPGRADE.md`:
- Week 1: Foundation (colors, typography, motion)
- Week 2: Core components (cards, player, sheets)
- Week 3: Screens (home, discover, library)
- Week 4: Polish (Lottie, visualization, accessibility)
